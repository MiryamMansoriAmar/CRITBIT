-SUMMARY-
This project consists in a website that allows users to search diverse kinds of videogames from different platforms. Users will be able to review them, give them an score, read news, among other things.
Users and their preferences will be saved in a database for a more personalized experience.

In order to get all the data, we shall use an API with a list of the games we'll want to show in our page.
